HeadMotionTool version history

1.0.0 2012-07-13
  - First release
1.0.1 2012-07-20
  - GUI command line argument implemented, which allows to run the program 
    as a command line tool only (the GUI does not appear).
  - Mouse cursor indicates when calculating.
  - Bug fixes:
    - nMin not integer in call to PartitionTimeSeries.
    - HeadSamplePeriod simplified and works even when data was resampled.
1.0.2 2012-10-05
  - Added "workarounds" to prevent extra clicks during calculations to be 
    queued, and to avoid changing radio button selection during 
    calculations.
  - Made compatible with older versions of Matlab (no ~ output).
  - Bug fixes:
    - "Save as initial position" button not enabled when it should be.
    - Fonts and transparency loaded from user settings file, but not applied.
    - Font size dialog cancel button or bad input caused errors.
    - Single-trial datasets with zeros (aborted) didn't work.
1.0.3 2012-10-09
  - Simplified calculating the initial "stable" inter-coil distances, 
    reducing computation time by more than half and removing the need for 
    mex files.
  - Behaves adequately when all trials are rejected, allowing to restore.
  - Bug fixes: 
    - Restoring the original head position didn't work properly; openhc 
      gave an error.
    - Restoring a dataset didn't properly update all fields and graphs.
    - Rejecting trials didn't properly update the "calculated median 
      distance from initial" field.
1.0.4 2012-10-10
  - changeHeadPos --help output is no longer displayed when testing if CTF 
    software installed.
  - Bug fixes:
    - Restoring a dataset was using the standard coil positions instead of 
      the measured positions (error in openhc).
    - Rejecting trials after correcting the initial position was using the 
      old initial position.
    - Program now correctly applies previous renderer instead of always 
      starting in transparency mode.
1.0.5 2013-10-08
  - Using command line version ('GUI', false), no longer loads the user 
    preference file.  This would lead to unpredictable behavior and 
    useless defaults.
  - User preference file no longer forced to be in program directory. Can 
    now be saved and loaded manually (new menus).  Will be loaded 
    automatically if found in the current working directory and using the GUI.
1.1 2014-06-05
  - Moved many subfunctions to a 'private' directory.
  - Created HeadMotionStats.
  - Could not reproduce reported bug in HeadMotionTool: doesn't correct 
    initial position when no GUI.
1.2 2016-03-11
  - Option to run with Fieldtrip data structures instead of CTF datasets, 
    from command line.
  - GUI changed to act "modal", i.e. output is now only returned when 
    figure is closed. 


Feature ideas:
  - Make correcting the initial position not depend on CTF software such 
    that the program works on any platform.
  - Add RejectTrials command line option that would however save a 
    screenshot of the figure before 
  - openhc should recognize "missing" hc data, i.e. file says something 
    like "data missing" instead of the normal content.  Use first position 
    and recreate?
